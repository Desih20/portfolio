      <h3>Hi! My name is Destin Hill.</h3>
      <p>I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Throughout my life, I have designed posters, science boards, and T-shirts. I knew I had a talent for designing, but I didn't know how to turn it into a career until my older sister helped me after my freshman year of college. Sadly, I don't have pictures of my designs from elementary and high school. However, I do have images of my designs I created so far in college. Please visit my portfolio in the navigation bar at the top. </p>
